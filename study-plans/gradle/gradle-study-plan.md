# Gradle Study Plan

As a software engineer, I want to understand deeply how Gradle works and apply it in my day-to-day.
I want to be able to write my own plugins, debug application building and apply improvements into existing 
projects.
a) I need to be able to explain the main concepts of Gradle.
b) I need to be able to build a simple Gradle build file to a Java project.
c) I need to be able to build a more complex Gradle build file, using and customizing different 
plugins and custom tasks.
d) I need to be able to build a multi-module Java project using multiple build files, each of them 
using different tasks and plugins.
e) I need to be able to write my own plugin that makes any task of moderate difficulty locally and use
it in a Java project.
f) I need to be able to use build script and caching in a Java project.
g) I need to be able to debug a build script of a Java project and describe in details what happens
when it runs.
